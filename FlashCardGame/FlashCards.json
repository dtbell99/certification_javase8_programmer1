		},
		{
			"question": "How do you access a super class method from a subclass in a different package?",
			"answer": "Mark it public or protected so the subclass has access to it. Default WILL not work."
		},

			"answer": "True"
		},
		{
			"question": "T/F Subclasses outside the package can instantiate and reference a superclass protected member?",
			"answer": "True; it must be accessed via the subclass dot notation otherwise instantiating the super class will fail to work on that member."
		},
		{
			"question": "T/F A class that instantiates another object which inherits a protected member can access that member?",
			"answer": "False; the subclass has access, but to all else it is private. So the compiler errors out about protected access in the original super class."
		},
		{
			"question": "T/F Default members are visible to subclasses ONLY if those subclasses are in the same package as the superclass?",
			"answer": "True"
		},
		{
			"question": "T/F Access modifiers can be applied to local variables?",
			"answer": "False, these will not compile and isn't allowed"
